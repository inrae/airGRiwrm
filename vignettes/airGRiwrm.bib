They are widely-used tools for real-time flow forecasting, flood design and climate change impact assessment, and they are often used for training and educational purposes. This article presents an R-package, airGR, to facilitate the implementation of the GR lumped hydrological models (including GR4J) and a snow-accumulation and melt model. The package allows users to calibrate and run hourly to annual models on catchment sets and to analyse their outputs. While the core of the models is implemented in Fortran, the user can manage the input/output data within R. A number of options and plotting functions are proposed to ease automate tests and analyses of the results. The codes are flexible enough to include external models, other calibration routines or efficiency criteria. To illustrate the features of airGR, we present one application example for a French mountainous catchment.},

Il s’agit du modèle TGR de type GR, dans un premier temps réalisé et calé sans prendre en compte les quatre lacs-réservoirs. Suivant certaines conditions, telles que la courbe de gestion de ces lacs et leurs volumes maximum et minimum admissibles, il a fallu les intégrer au modèle. Différents cas ont dû être déterminés auparavant, selon les particularités des lacs. Il faut reproduire au mieux les effets des lacs, leur courbe de volume et les débits dans les rivières, afin d’avoir un modèle le plus exact possible. Les chroniques de débits utilisées pour son calage sont celles des débits naturalisés, débits mesurés desquels l’influence des lacs a été effacée. Les autres actions anthropiques (prélèvements AEP…) sont présentes. Les indicateurs de performance indiquant que le modèle était suffisamment proche de la réalité, il a alors été possible de passer à la phase suivante, c'est-à-dire la modélisation avec les forçages des modèles climatiques du GIEC (Groupe d’experts Intergouvernemental sur l’Evolution du Climat). Ces simulations doivent permettre d’établir une tendance de l’effet des lacs en temps futur par rapport au temps présent. Pour cela, quatorze ensembles de données fournies par le GIEC (sept en temps présent et sept en temps futur) ont été utilisées dans les simulations. De ces simulations, il semble apparaitre que le futur sera plus sec que le présent, avec des crues mieux absorbées et des étiages plus sévères, que les dépassements du débit de référence diminuent sur les rivières Aube et Marne, et que, si leurs causes restent inchangées pour la Marne, elles évoluent pour les autres lacs.},

  abstract = {In semidistributed hydrological modeling, sequential calibration usually refers to the calibration of a model by considering not only the flows observed at the outlet of a catchment but also the different gauging points inside the catchment from upstream to downstream. While sequential calibration aims to optimize the performance at these interior gauged points, we show that it generally fails to improve performance at ungauged points. In this paper, we propose a regularization approach for the sequential calibration of semidistributed hydrological models. It consists in adding a priori information on optimal parameter sets for each modeling unit of the semidistributed model. Calibration iterations are then performed by jointly maximizing simulation performance and minimizing drifts from the a priori parameter sets. The combination of these two sources of information is handled by a parameter k to which the method is quite sensitive. The method is applied to 1,305 catchments in France over 30 years. The leave-one-out validation shows that, at locations considered as ungauged, model simulations are significantly improved (over all the catchments, the median KGE criterion is increased from 0.75 to 0.83 and the first quartile from 0.35 to 0.66), while model performance at gauged points is not significantly impacted by the use of the regularization approach. Small catchments benefit most from this calibration strategy. These performances are, however, very similar to the performances obtained with a lumped model based on similar conceptualization.},

  abstract = {Adaptation strategies will be needed to cope with the hydrological consequences of projected climate change. In this perspective, the management of many artificial reservoirs will have to be adapted to continue to fulfil downstream objectives (e.g. flow regulation). This study evaluates the sustainability of the management rules of the artificial reservoirs on the Seine River basin, France, under climate change scenarios. The Seine River basin at Paris (43,800 km2) has major socio-economic stakes for France, and the consequences of droughts and floods may be dramatic. In this context, four large multi-purpose reservoirs were built on the basin during the twentieth century for low-flow augmentation and flood alleviation. A hydrological modelling chain was designed to explicitly account for reservoir management rules. It was calibrated in current conditions and then fed by the outputs of seven climate models in present and future conditions, forced by the A1B IPCC scenario, downscaled using a weather-type method and statistically bias-corrected. The results show that the hydrological model performs quite well in current conditions. The simulations made in present and future conditions indicate a decrease in water availability and summer low flows, but no significant trends in high flows. Simulations also indicate that there is room for progress in the current multi-purpose management of reservoirs and that it would be useful to define proper adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Water levels of streams and rivers in the United Kingdom have been regulated by weirs for more than one thousand years, but regulation of the flow regime by impoundments began in the latter half on the 19th Century. Organized river flow measurements were not undertaken until 1935, and today the average record length is about 20 years. Only three gauging stations have provided data suitable for pre- and post-impoundment comparisons. Other studies have relied on the comparison of regulated and naturalized discharges. In either case climate and land-use changes make evaluation of the hydrological effect of impoundments problematic. This paper reviews research on hydrological changes due to river regulation in the UK, and presents a case study of the River Severn to evaluate the influence of Clywedog Reservoir on flood magnitude and frequency. Consequent upon dam completion, on average, median flows have been reduced by about 50per cent; mean annual floods have been reduced by about 30per cent; and low flows have been maintained at about 22 per cent higher than the natural Q95 discharge. However, marked differences exist between rivers. The direct effect of reservoir compensation flows and the indirect effect of inter basin transfers for supply have significantly increased minimum flows in most rivers, although in the case of the latter this involves the discharge of treated effluents. In contrast, the effects of impoundments on flood magnitude and frequency is less clear and on the River Severn, at least, changes in flood hydrology during the past two decades are shown to be more related to climate change than to river regulation.},

The variation in the model performance is strongly correlated with the linearity of the annual rainfall/runoff relationship and a climate index. At the monthly scale, runoff routing becomes significant, and the introduction of a two-parameter routeing algorithm significantly improves the monthly runoff simulations giving efficiencies of 90\% and 88\% for the Severn and Thames respectively. The results provide guidance to climate modellers looking for efficient and robust land-surface parameterizations, and indicate the potential application of such a modelling scheme to water resource managers.},

  abstract = {The concept of defining environmental flow regimes to balance the provision of water resources for both human and environmental needs has gained wide recognition. As the authority responsible for water resource management within England, the Environment Agency (EA) uses the Environmental Flow Indicator (EFI), which represents an allowable percentage deviation from the natural flow to determine where water may be available for new abstractions. In a simplified form, the EFI has been used as the hydrological supporting component of Water Framework Directive classification, to flag where hydrological alteration may be contributing to failure to achieve good ecological status, and to guide further ecological investigation. As the primary information source for the EFI was expert opinion, the EA aims to improve the evidence base linking flow alteration and ecological response, and to use this evidence to develop improved environmental flow criteria and implementation tools. Such tools will be required to make predictions at locations with no or limited ecological monitoring data. Hence empirical statistical models are required that provide a means to describe observed variation in ecological sensitivity to flow change. Models must also strike a balance between generic and local relationships. Multilevel (mixed effects) regression models provide a rich set of capabilities suitable for this purpose. Three brief examples of the application of these techniques in defining empirical relationships between flow alteration and ecological response are provided. Establishment of testable hydrological–ecological relationships provides the framework for improving data collection, analysis, and ultimately water resources management models.

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, several naturalization methods have been developed for removing anthropogenic influences from streamflow time series, to the point that naturalized flows are often considered true natural flows in many studies. However, such trust in a particular naturalization method does not expose the assumptions underlying the method, nor does it quantifies the associated uncertainty. This review provides an overview of streamflow naturalization approaches. The terminology associated with naturalization is discussed, and a classification of naturalization methods according to their data requirements and main assumptions is proposed. A large set of studies developing or applying naturalization methods are reviewed, and the main challenges associated with the methods applied are assessed. To give a more concrete example, a focus is made on studies conducted in France over the last decade, which applied naturalization methods to estimate water extraction limits in rivers.},

  abstract = {The main objectives of the project have been addressed by combining a European modelling approach with case study analysis and regional (local) knowledge of water demand and water availability considering climate change as well as socio-economic developments. An integrated assessment for entire Europe was performed under the consideration of different scenarios and cli-mate change projections. This large-scale perspective allows indicating regions which are po¬ten-tially vulnerable to climate change and furthermore to identify regional adaptation measures which could be promoted at the EU level. Additionally three case studies were selected across Europe to in¬vestigate changes in hydrologic regimes, water availability and sectoral water use. These case stu¬dies are focusing on three different water management issues in three different regions. In the first case study, the influence of climate change on the hydromorphological conditions according to the WFD were evaluated for a section of the Eder River (Germany). The objective of this case study was to examine whether the environmental WFD objectives can be achieved in a typical river section considering climate change impacts. The second case study investigated water management, especially drinking water provision, and flood alleviation in the Seine river basin (France), which is partly based on the operation of artificial reservoirs. Scenarios were developed linking the impact of climate change on water resources and changes in water demand and its management. The third case study assesses the quantitative effects of climate change on water balance components and water use in the agricultural sector of the Italian Apulia region, in order to support the adoption of adaptation measures. Actually, in the Apulia region agriculture still remains the primary user of water and the primary economical resource. / Les principaux objectifs du projet ont été adressés en combinant une approche de modélisation européenne avec une analyse de cas d\&\#8217;études et la connaissance régionale (locale) des demandes et disponibilités en eau en considérant le changement climatique ainsi que les développements socio-économiques. Une estimation intégrée pour l\&\#8217;Europe entière a été entreprise en considérant différents scénarios et projections de changement climatique. Cette perspective à large échelle permet d\&\#8217;identifier des régions qui sont potentiellement vulnérables au changement climatique mais aussi d\&\#8217;identifier les mesures d\&\#8217;adaptation qui pourraient être développées au niveau européen. De plus, trois cas d\&\#8217;étude ont été sélectionnés à travers l\&\#8217;Europe pour étudier les changements dans les régimes hydrologiques, la disponibilité en eau, et les usages de l\&\#8217;eau. Ces cas d\&\#8217;étude concernent trois différents problèmes de gestion de l\&\#8217;eau dans trois régions différentes. Dans le premier cas d\&\#8217;étude, l\&\#8217;influence du changement climatique sur les conditions hydromorphologiques selon la DCE ont été évaluées pour une section de la rivière Eder (Allemagne). L\&\#8217;objectif de ce cas d\&\#8217;étude était d\&\#8217;examiner si l\&\#8217;objectif environnemental de la DCE peut être rempli dans une section typique de la rivière en considérant le changement climatique. Le second cas d\&\#8217;étude s\&\#8217;est penché sur la gestion de l\&\#8217;eau, plus spécialement de la fourniture en eau potable, et sur la mitigation des crues sur le bassin de la Seine (France), qui est partiellement basée sur l\&\#8217;exploitation de réservoirs artificiels. Des scénarios ont été développés pour évaluer l\&\#8217;impact du changement climatique sur les ressources en eau en testant différents modes de gestion des réservoirs. Le troisième cas d\&\#8217;étude a évalué les effets quantitatifs du changement climatique sur les composantes du bilan en eau et sur l\&\#8217;utilisation de l\&\#8217;eau sur le secteur agricole de la région des Pouilles en Italie, afin de soutenir l\&\#8217;adoption de mesures d\&\#8217;adaptation. En fait, la région des Pouilles l\&\#8217;agriculture reste le principal utilisateur d\&\#8217;eau et la principale ressource économique.}

  abstract = {The assessment of regional climate change requires the development of reference long-term retrospective meteorological datasets. This article presents an 8-km-resolution atmospheric reanalysis over France performed with the the Safran-gauge-based analysis system for the period 1958–2008. Climatological features of the Safran 50-year analysis—long-term mean values, inter-annual and seasonal variability—are first presented for all computed variables: rainfall, snowfall, mean air temperature, specific humidity, wind speed and solar and infrared radiation. The spatial patterns of precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature are compared with another spatialization method, and the temporal consistency of the reanalysis is assessed through various validation experiments with both dependent and independent data. These experiments demonstrate the overall robustness of the Safran reanalysis and the improvement of its quality with time, in connection with the sharp increase in the observation network density that occurred in the 1990s. They also show the differentiated sensitivity of variables to the number of available ground observations, with precipitation and air temperature being the more robust ones. The comparison of trends from the reanalysis with those from homogenized series finally shows that if spatial patterns are globally consistent with both approaches, care must be taken when using literal values from the reanalysis and corresponding statistical significance in climate change detection studies. The Safran 50-year atmospheric reanalysis constitutes a long-term forcing datasets for land surface schemes and thus enables the simulation of the past 50 years of water resources over France.
