	abstract = {This dataset provides hydro-meteorological timeseries and landscape attributes for 671 catchments across Great Britain. It collates river flows, catchment attributes and catchment boundaries from the {UK} National River Flow Archive together with a suite of new meteorological timeseries and catchment attributes. Daily timeseries for the time period 1st October 1970 to the 30th September 2015 are provided for a range of hydro-meteorological data (including rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, radiation, humidity and flow). A comprehensive set of catchment attributes are quantified describing a range of catchment characteristics including topography, climate, hydrology, land cover, soils, hydrogeology, human influences and discharge uncertainty. This dataset is intended for the community as a freely available, easily accessible dataset to use in a wide range of environmental data and modelling analyses. A research paper (Coxon et al, {CAMELS}-{GB}: Hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes for 671 catchments in Great Britain) describing the dataset in detail will be made available in Earth System Science Data (https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/).},
