	abstract = {This dataset provides hydro-meteorological timeseries and landscape attributes for 671 catchments across Great Britain. It collates river flows, catchment attributes and catchment boundaries from the {UK} National River Flow Archive together with a suite of new meteorological timeseries and catchment attributes. Daily timeseries for the time period 1st October 1970 to the 30th September 2015 are provided for a range of hydro-meteorological data (including rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, radiation, humidity and flow). A comprehensive set of catchment attributes are quantified describing a range of catchment characteristics including topography, climate, hydrology, land cover, soils, hydrogeology, human influences and discharge uncertainty. This dataset is intended for the community as a freely available, easily accessible dataset to use in a wide range of environmental data and modelling analyses. A research paper (Coxon et al, {CAMELS}-{GB}: Hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes for 671 catchments in Great Britain) describing the dataset in detail will be made available in Earth System Science Data (https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/).},

	abstract = {Water levels of streams and rivers in the United Kingdom have been regulated by weirs for more than one thousand years, but regulation of the flow regime by impoundments began in the latter half on the 19th Century. Organized river flow measurements were not undertaken until 1935, and today the average record length is about 20 years. Only three gauging stations have provided data suitable for pre- and post-impoundment comparisons. Other studies have relied on the comparison of regulated and naturalized discharges. In either case climate and land-use changes make evaluation of the hydrological effect of impoundments problematic. This paper reviews research on hydrological changes due to river regulation in the {UK}, and presents a case study of the River Severn to evaluate the influence of Clywedog Reservoir on flood magnitude and frequency. Consequent upon dam completion, on average, median flows have been reduced by about 50per cent; mean annual floods have been reduced by about 30per cent; and low flows have been maintained at about 22 per cent higher than the natural Q95 discharge. However, marked differences exist between rivers. The direct effect of reservoir compensation flows and the indirect effect of inter basin transfers for supply have significantly increased minimum flows in most rivers, although in the case of the latter this involves the discharge of treated effluents. In contrast, the effects of impoundments on flood magnitude and frequency is less clear and on the River Severn, at least, changes in flood hydrology during the past two decades are shown to be more related to climate change than to river regulation.},

	abstract = {A continuous flow simulation model({CLASSIC}) has been used to assess the potential impactof climate and land use changes on the flood regimesof large U.K. catchments. Climate change scenarios,based on the {HadCM}2 experiments from the {HadleyCentre}, are applied to the Severn and Thames rivers.The analysis shows that, for the 2050s, the climatechange scenarios result in an increase in both thefrequency and magnitude of flooding events in theserivers. The various ways of applying the rainfallscenario can have a significant effect on thesegeneral conclusions, although generally do not affecteither the direction or consistency of the changes.While ‘best guess’ land use changes show little impacton flood response, a 50\% increase in forest covercould counter-act the impact of climate change. Aswould be expected, a large change in the urban coverof the catchments does have a large effect on theflood regimes, increasing both the frequency andmagnitude of floods significantly beyond the changesdue to climate alone. Further research is requiredinto the potential impacts of seasonal changes in thedaily rainfall and potential evaporation regimes, landuse changes and the interaction between the two.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the issues of scale and appropriate model complexity for large-scale hydrological models. A grid-based hydrological model, which employs the {UK} Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System, is applied to the Severn and Thames catchments using a grid scale of 40 km, and is shown to reproduce the observed mean annual runoff over a 10-year period to within 6\% with no prior calibration. The variation in the model performance is strongly correlated with the linearity of the annual rainfall/runoff relationship and a climate index. At the monthly scale, runoff routing becomes significant, and the introduction of a two-parameter routeing algorithm significantly improves the monthly runoff simulations giving efficiencies of 90\% and 88\% for the Severn and Thames respectively. The results provide guidance to climate modellers looking for efficient and robust land-surface parameterizations, and indicate the potential application of such a modelling scheme to water resource managers.},
