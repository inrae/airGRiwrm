  abstract = {It is essential to standardize the definitions and approaches to quantifying various irrigation performance measures. The ASCE Task Committee on Defining Irrigation Efficiency and Uniformity provides a comprehensive examination of various performance indices such as irrigation efficiency, application efficiency, irrigation sagacity, distribution uniformity, and others. Consistency is provided among different irrigation methods and different scales. Clarification of common points of confusion is provided, and methods are proposed whereby the accuracy of numerical values of the performance indicators can be assessed. This issue has two companion papers that provide more detailed information on statistical distribution uniformity and the accuracy of irrigation efficiency estimates.},

  abstract = {Lumped hydrological models are catchment-scale representations of the transformation of precipitation into discharge. They are widely-used tools for real-time flow forecasting, flood design and climate change impact assessment, and they are often used for training and educational purposes. This article presents an R-package, airGR, to facilitate the implementation of the GR lumped hydrological models (including GR4J) and a snow-accumulation and melt model. The package allows users to calibrate and run hourly to annual models on catchment sets and to analyse their outputs. While the core of the models is implemented in Fortran, the user can manage the input/output data within R. A number of options and plotting functions are proposed to ease automate tests and analyses of the results. The codes are flexible enough to include external models, other calibration routines or efficiency criteria. To illustrate the features of airGR, we present one application example for a French mountainous catchment.},

It collates river flows, catchment attributes and catchment boundaries from the UK National River Flow Archive together with a suite of new meteorological timeseries and catchment attributes. Daily timeseries for the time period 1st October 1970 to the 30th September 2015 are provided for a range of hydro-meteorological data (including rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, radiation, humidity and flow). A comprehensive set of catchment attributes are quantified describing a range of catchment characteristics including topography, climate, hydrology, land cover, soils, hydrogeology, human influences and discharge uncertainty. This dataset is intended for the community as a freely available, easily accessible dataset to use in a wide range of environmental data and modelling analyses. A research paper (Coxon et al, CAMELS-GB: Hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes for 671 catchments in Great Britain) describing the dataset in detail will be made available in Earth System Science Data (https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/).},

  abstract = {Water levels of streams and rivers in the United Kingdom have been regulated by weirs for more than one thousand years, but regulation of the flow regime by impoundments began in the latter half on the 19th Century. Organized river flow measurements were not undertaken until 1935, and today the average record length is about 20 years. Only three gauging stations have provided data suitable for pre- and post-impoundment comparisons. Other studies have relied on the comparison of regulated and naturalized discharges. In either case climate and land-use changes make evaluation of the hydrological effect of impoundments problematic. This paper reviews research on hydrological changes due to river regulation in the UK, and presents a case study of the River Severn to evaluate the influence of Clywedog Reservoir on flood magnitude and frequency. Consequent upon dam completion, on average, median flows have been reduced by about 50per cent; mean annual floods have been reduced by about 30per cent; and low flows have been maintained at about 22 per cent higher than the natural Q95 discharge. However, marked differences exist between rivers. The direct effect of reservoir compensation flows and the indirect effect of inter basin transfers for supply have significantly increased minimum flows in most rivers, although in the case of the latter this involves the discharge of treated effluents. In contrast, the effects of impoundments on flood magnitude and frequency is less clear and on the River Severn, at least, changes in flood hydrology during the past two decades are shown to be more related to climate change than to river regulation.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the issues of scale and appropriate model complexity for large-scale hydrological models. A grid-based hydrological model, which employs the UK Meteorological Office Rainfall and Evaporation Calculation System, is applied to the Severn and Thames catchments using a grid scale of 40 km, and is shown to reproduce the observed mean annual runoff over a 10-year period to within 6\% with no prior calibration. The variation in the model performance is strongly correlated with the linearity of the annual rainfall/runoff relationship and a climate index. At the monthly scale, runoff routing becomes significant, and the introduction of a two-parameter routeing algorithm significantly improves the monthly runoff simulations giving efficiencies of 90\% and 88\% for the Severn and Thames respectively. The results provide guidance to climate modellers looking for efficient and robust land-surface parameterizations, and indicate the potential application of such a modelling scheme to water resource managers.},

  abstract = {The concept of defining environmental flow regimes to balance the provision of water resources for both human and environmental needs has gained wide recognition. As the authority responsible for water resource management within England, the Environment Agency (EA) uses the Environmental Flow Indicator (EFI), which represents an allowable percentage deviation from the natural flow to determine where water may be available for new abstractions. In a simplified form, the EFI has been used as the hydrological supporting component of Water Framework Directive classification, to flag where hydrological alteration may be contributing to failure to achieve good ecological status, and to guide further ecological investigation. As the primary information source for the EFI was expert opinion, the EA aims to improve the evidence base linking flow alteration and ecological response, and to use this evidence to develop improved environmental flow criteria and implementation tools. Such tools will be required to make predictions at locations with no or limited ecological monitoring data. Hence empirical statistical models are required that provide a means to describe observed variation in ecological sensitivity to flow change. Models must also strike a balance between generic and local relationships. Multilevel (mixed effects) regression models provide a rich set of capabilities suitable for this purpose. Three brief examples of the application of these techniques in defining empirical relationships between flow alteration and ecological response are provided. Establishment of testable hydrological\textendash ecological relationships provides the framework for improving data collection, analysis, and ultimately water resources management models.

Climate change scenarios,based on the HadCM2 experiments from the HadleyCentre, are applied to the Severn and Thames rivers.The analysis shows that, for the 2050s, the climatechange scenarios result in an increase in both thefrequency and magnitude of flooding events in theserivers. The various ways of applying the rainfallscenario can have a significant effect on thesegeneral conclusions, although generally do not affecteither the direction or consistency of the changes.While `best guess' land use changes show little impacton flood response, a 50\% increase in forest covercould counter-act the impact of climate change. Aswould be expected, a large change in the urban coverof the catchments does have a large effect on theflood regimes, increasing both the frequency andmagnitude of floods significantly beyond the changesdue to climate alone. Further research is requiredinto the potential impacts of seasonal changes in thedaily rainfall and potential evaporation regimes, landuse changes and the interaction between the two.},
